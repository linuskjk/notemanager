# üìù Note Manager

A simple local note-taking app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This version is for **personal use only**, with no accounts, no server-side storage, and no live sync features.

## Features

- Create notes with a **custom name and content**
- Save notes in the browser (using `localStorage`)
- View, edit, and delete existing notes
- Generate and import a **shareable code** for note transfer between devices
- Clean and responsive interface

## How It Works

- Notes are saved to the browser's local storage using a unique name.
- The "Export Code" feature allows you to copy a note's data to share it or move it to another browser.
- The "Import Code" feature lets you paste shared note data to restore the note.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla)

## Getting Started

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Start creating notes!

## Limitations

- Notes are not synced between devices.
- Notes are stored only in the browser you‚Äôre using.
- If you clear your browser data, all notes will be lost.

## Future Ideas

- Add search or tags
- Backup/export all notes as one file
- Add dark mode
